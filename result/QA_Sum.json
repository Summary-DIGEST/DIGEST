        "dialogue": "#Person1#: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?\n#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.",

In today's show, our young, but experienced, guest will introduce us to the fantastic world of bearded dragons. Welcome, Joshua. [Thank you very much.] Now, Joshua, I must admit that a bearded dragon sounds something like out of a fantasy book. What exactly is a bearded dragon?\n#Person2#: Well, here. Why don't you hold on to Bert, [Oh ... Wow!] while I talk about him. [Okay] Bearded dragons actually originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Today, beardies like this one are bred in captivity here in the US.\n#Person3#: Okay. And, so what are some of the essential things to know when getting a bearded dragon? I mean, can you raise one as a family pet?\n#Person2#: Bearded dragons make a great family pet and are very docile creatures.\n#Person1#: Yeah, this one seems quite friendly.\n#Person2#: You just need to know how to care for them.\n#Person1#: Well, what are some of the things you should keep in mind?\n#Person2#: First, you need to have the right supplies: some kind of enclosure ...\n#Person1#: Like, like a cage or something like that.\n#Person2#: Yeah. [Okay] A full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp [Okay], branches and rocks to climb on and bask on, a food or water dish, and something to line bottom of the cage.\n#Person1#: Okay, well, let's get down to some the basics. What are the dietary needs of a bearded dragon? It sounds like a very carnivorous beast. Perhaps, uh, they eat fiery Mexican tacos or something like that.\n#Person4#: No, bearded dragons are omnivores...\n#Person1#: Now, Omnivores? What exactly is that?\n#Person2#: Uh, creatures that eat insects, vegetable, and greens, the leafy parts of plants and their stems.\n#Person1#: Okay. You mean like, for example, carrots or something like that for example. [Yeah] Okay.\n#Person2#: Young dragons like Bert can be fed small crickets twice a day, along with some greens and shredded vegetables. [Okay.] And then as your dragon grows, you can increase the amount of greens and vegetables. [Alright.] And you can also dust the vegetables and insects with a calcium supplement to promote bone growth.\n#Person1#: Okay, and what about water? Uh, what kind of needs do they have for that?\n#Person2#: Well, since bearded dragons traditionally live in arid regions, they obtain most of their water naturally from what they eat, so you have to be sure to feed them plenty of vegetables that serve as good carriers of water. [Okay.] You also spray them occasionally with a water bottle or provide them with a shallow water dish. Whatever you do, but sure to keep the cage dry, [Okay.] or else mold and bacteria can grow that could make your dragon sick. [Okay.], and finally, you mentioned about lighting earlier. What do you need exactly to keep your beardie happy and healthy?\n#Person5#: Having a full spectrum light and basking lamp are pretty key to raising healthy beardies. First, they need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet UV bulb ...\n#Person1#: Now, is that the full spectrum light that you mentioned? Okay.\n#Person2#: ... to absorb rays [Okay.], vital to the production of certain vitamins, [Okay.] and the high body temperatures of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.\n#Person1#: Now, what kinds of temperatures are you referring to when you talk about the basking area?\n#Person2#: Like ninety to a hundred degrees.\n#Person1#: Okay, and I don't think they need sun tan lotion, right? [No]. Okay, uh, so, perhaps then, I could put my beardie in an aquarium and just set him by the window which gets direct sunlight? Would that work?\n#Person2#: Well, actually, you can even take them outside two or three times a week in the direct sunlight; however, putting them in a glass aquarium with exposure to sunlight won't be viewed as a replacement for direct light or a UV bulb because the glass only filters out the sunlight they need.\n#Person1#: Wow! I didn't know there was so much to know about raising a pet like that. Well, thanks very much for joining us today, Joshua.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.",

Bearded dragons originated from the deserts of Australia, and this is one of several species that survived in that climate. Joshua tells the audience that raising bearded dragons needs to prepare some kind of enclosure, a full spectrum fluorescent light bulb and a basking lamp, branches and rocks, a food or water dish, and something to line the bottom of the cage. Bearded dragons are omnivores and can be fed by insects, vegetables, and greens, the leafy parts of plants, and their stems. People should keep the cage dry. They need the simulated sunlight from the ultraviolet (UV) bulb and ninety to a hundred degrees of a basking light to aid in the digestive process.",
        "response": "On the show Exotic Animal Kingdom, host Person1 interviews guest Joshua about bearded dragons. Joshua explains they originated from Australian deserts, are docile family pets, and details care: essential supplies (enclosure, lights, climbing items, dishes, cage lining); omnivorous diet (young eat crickets twice daily plus greens/veggies, adults more greens/veggies, calcium supplement); water from food, occasional spraying/shallow dish, keep cage dry; need full spectrum UV light and 90-100 degree basking lamp (glass filters UV, so direct sunlight or bulb required). Joshua notes they make great pets with proper care."

We have a couple of economy, compact, and full-size cars available, or a nice minivan.\n#Person2#: Well, what is the main difference between these cars?\n#Person3#: The main difference is size. The economy car is the smallest, and it seats fewer passengers and can hold less luggage. [Okay.] How many people are with you?\n#Person2#: Just me and my son.\n#Person1#: Well, the economy car would work. We have one right out front.\n#Person2#: Where? That one?

Will there be any other drivers?\n#Person2#: No, I'm the only driver.\n#Person1#: Okay.

It even includes incidental road damage caused by, let's say, a huge boulder rolling down the mountain and crushing your car. [Oh, uh, well ... ].

Okay. Let me just confirm this. A full-size car with a car seat for three days [Yeah], plus the car protection package. Is that right? [That's right.] Okay, I'll have our mechanic, Louie, check the car over and pull it up to the door.\n#Person2#: Push it up to the door?
