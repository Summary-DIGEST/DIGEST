There are also some financial costs, are there?\nMichaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.\nJessie: so what do we get from it really?\nMichaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.\nMichaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>\nRon: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association\nJessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually\nMichaela: I recall two as well\nSteve: but do we truly need those subsidies?
