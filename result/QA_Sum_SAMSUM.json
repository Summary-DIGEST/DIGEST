I was fine, but recently it's a real nightmare\nKaren: You should quit eating gluten and see, otherwise you should look for a different explanation.

And they're nice enough that if I ask them to do something, they actually do it :D\nRoseanne: LOL, okay. Actually, I think that when I tell them to go and help aunt Meg with cleaning, they'll think it's fun.\nVince: And when you tell them to clean their own rooms, they say you're a monster? :D\nRoseanne: Exactly. But Bill for example always cleans the windows at my parents house. They don't even need to ask anymore, he simply knows it's his job.\nKyle: Do they pay him? :P\nRoseanne: Well, sometimes. But still I think he likes doing it. I don't know, maybe it's because no one checks if he did it well, he's just left alone to do his thing, so he feels like a man in the house in a way?\nMegan: Tell them I can pay with cookies if they help me.\nRoseanne: The famous chocolate cookies?\nMegan: Why not? I'm feeling generous today :D\nRoseanne: Guys, I think I'm gonna change my mind about that beer. Meg, would you accept one more helper? :D\nMegan: You're always welcome!

Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.\nSteve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility\nRon: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?\nMichaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.\nJessie: so what do we get from it really?\nMichaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.\nMichaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>\nRon: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association\nJessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually\nMichaela: I recall two as well\nSteve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.\nSteve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours\nRon: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding\nMichaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things.

Jason points out many people mix cannabis with tobacco, while Tom questions the size relationship between joints and spliffs and the legality of studies given federal illegality. Others discuss alternative cannabis uses like oil and edibles to avoid lung harm, dispute claims of cannabis harming lungs, and note that some cannabis users resist negative information about it."
