Do we have anyone willing to take care of the paperwork? Doesn't have to be one person.\nSteve: Frankly, I don't see anyone doing this - we all have jobs, barely have time for meetings sometimes and it's a ton of responsibility\nRon: The question is - do the profits of being an association surpass the costs - like the amount of time and work we put into it? There are also some financial costs, are there?\nMichaela: yeah, like a small fee when you set it up, but nothing more really.\nJessie: so what do we get from it really?\nMichaela: maybe the cost of a rubber stamp.\nMichaela: for example here are subsidies the city gives out every year, but to apply you need to be a formal association <file_other>\nRon: and there was this time when that community center refused to work with us, because we weren't an association\nJessie: I think there were two times we were rejected cause of that actually\nMichaela: I recall two as well\nSteve: but do we truly need those subsidies? We've worked for almost 4 years without them and for me that was the beauty of it - that you can organize events without spending tons of money on it, just with collective effort.\nSteve: I'm just afraid we're gonna lose this sense of an informal get-together, it's all just gonna turn into a business and will create tensions between us. I've seen it happen to clubs like ours\nRon: it's not necessarily going to happen to us and we could make some better events with more funding\nMichaela: association is not a business, we're not gonna start selling things.

Victoria suggests replacing lamb with lentils for a vegetarian shepherd's pie, Jim notes lentils, beans, and chickpeas as nutritious alternatives, and Tom clarifies veggie chilli has only veggies and beans. Amanda decides to cook veggie chilli herself after getting these ideas, including vegetarian options like lentil shepherd's pie, macaroni cauliflower cheese, and veggie chilli."

We can discuss eyebrow/face geometry, brow mapping, how to tint/dye them (should you wish to, I have brown and black dye with me and I welcome you to use it), and how to fill them in with makeup.  Let me know if you would like to join!\nGerardo: Yall can clean my eyebrows if u need a pair to practice on\nAshley: If you are curious how my passion for eyebrows began, it was because I was formerly the program manager overseeing the implementation of a program designed to help individuals going through cancer regain self-confidence through beauty techniques - with a heavy emphasis on drawing on new eyebrows. <file_link>\nAnna: <file_gif>\nAshley: Gery, fully expect you to attend this skillshare now that you have offered yourself up.\nGerardo: A man is nothing without his word.

But cannabis causes more inflammation of the lungs and increase symptoms such as wheeziness and shortness of breath. But these subside when cannabis smoking ceases.\nJeremy: Wrong, it wasn't long term use, but rather an \"occasional low cumulative\", which could be something like smoking once or twice a month.\nMax: Tom You didn\u2019t watch the video.\nTom: I was just about to complain, then i saw your post. Thanks. ;)\nJason: I like how he doesn't mention the fact that most people smoking spliffs will probably be using tobacco in them as well pretty much everybody I know who smokes weed put tobacco in them and they smoke cigarettes as well.\nDaniel: Short attention span \ud83d\ude0a\nMax: Daniel probably from pot \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nMax: Jason he does - rewatch the end man. He doesn\u2019t specifically say combing the two , but he says one usually precedes the other. \nDavid: Jason, I used to smoke baccy avec hashish but no longer, and I know only one person out of billions who still smokes weed with tobacco.\nRawiri: Jason Hollis yuck...why even???\nTom: I know that a joint is bigger than a roach, so is a spliff bigger than a joint?\nDavid: I don\u2019t believe there is a size relationship between names of roll-ups (except for the roach which is a mostly smoked roll-up). I say that the names began as code words for an illegal item at that time. Some spliffs may be big some joints be small...\nKen: Allen So quit smoking it and no inflammation which we all know that inflammation is the number one cause of all other health issues.\nTom: BTW Seeing it's still illegal at a federal level, I'd like to know where such studies were conducted legally. Propaganda. Keep gobbling those opiate based pills, they're fine\nBrian: this is only stating the harms of smoking cannabis. It's not saying cannabis is harmful... there are other ways to use it without turning to opiates.\nKen: Really? Putting smoke in your lungs is bad for your respiratory system.....shocker. oil....edibles...many ways to enjoy and get relief from chronic pain and or what ever you need to get on with it.\nMark: Cannabis does not have a bad affect on the lungs!!\nVirginia: MJ users will not believe anything bad.

Allen claims long-term cannabis use has no major long-term consequences but causes temporary lung inflammation, which Jeremy corrects to \"occasional low cumulative use\" (e.g., once/twice a month). Jason argues the video ignores tobacco in spliffs and concurrent cigarette smoking; Max says the video mentions one (tobacco/cannabis) usually precedes the other, while David disputes Jason\u2019s prevalence claim. Ken notes quitting cannabis smoking reduces inflammation (a key health issue cause) and suggests alternatives like oil/edibles for chronic pain. Tom questions study legality, calls it propaganda, and mocks opiate pills. Brian clarifies the video addresses smoking harms, not cannabis itself, with non-smoking alternatives. Mark claims cannabis has no lung effect; Virginia argues users dismiss negative claims, comparing it to kale. Disagreements arise over study specifics, tobacco mixing, and lung harm validity."
